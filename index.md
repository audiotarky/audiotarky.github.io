# Audiotarky

Audiotarky is a new streaming platform, focussed on paying musicians directly & clearly for all the music they create.

## For musicians & producers

**Audiotarky provides you with two ways to share & get paid for your creations.**

We offer a streaming platform, where you are paid directly via micropayments as people listen to your music. These payments are done via [Coil][], and start at [$0.36 an hour](https://help.coil.com/accounts/membership-accounts#how-much-do-you-pay-out-to-creators). We believe this to be the highest "pay per stream" rate out there.

We also provide a way to share & be remunerated for your musical scraps, offcuts, out takes and unfinished symphonies. Have a great beat you're never going to use? Some sweet chord progression that sounds lovely but doesn't quite fit with where your heads at? Upload it to Audiotarky and let others use it in their creations. You will be streamed payment as people browse your library.

You get to [choose the license](https://creativecommons.org/choose/) for all your creations, decide whether they are only available to Coil users and whether they can be embeded/shared on other sites.

If any of this sounds interesting, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/7irCZKrSUaZjRnZk7) to sign up to the beta program.

## For fans

Audiotarky uses [Coil][] to directly stream micropayments to artists, while you are listening to their music. Coil can be used to [watch movies](https://cinnamon.video/), or enjoy reading [blogs](https://coil.com/blogs) or other [articles](https://www.coinspeaker.com/conde-nast-xrp-coil-monetization/).

This means you can pay a single subscription and enjoy content of all kinds across the web, safe in the knowledge that the people behind that are being remunerated for their work.

We're focussed on getting the musician experience right from day one, but plan to find ways to help fans find new & exciting music & be paid for sharing music with friends.

## About

Audiotarky is funded by [Grant for the web](https://www.grantfortheweb.org) and aims to diversify income streams for musicians via [Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org/). We get micropayments as people browse the site, and take the first 10 seconds of payment when people listen to music. Audiotarky is based in Bristol, UK.
